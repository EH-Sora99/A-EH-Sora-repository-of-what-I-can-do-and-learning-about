# A EH-Sora repository of what I can do and learning about
## Who is EH-Sora?
Hi everyone and wellcome to this mess of a GitHub repo.
<br>I goes by EH-Sora mostly online and do a lot of diffrent things.
<br>
<br>I mainly make YouTube videos about a bit whatever I feel like doing.
<br>I have some knowlage in game dev, due to study it in high school and something I want to do more.
<br>
<br>I'm from Sweden and speaks and write in English almost fluent, I have dyslexia and ADHD and are a bit all over the place at times and start random "side quests" (like this project) and get destracted on something and basiclly "forget" what I was doing.

### Where to find me?
You usually can find me on:
* YouTube
* Bluesky

## About this project?
The goal of this project is to acts and a bit of an archive and show some of what I can do.
<br>I'm starting with simple "HelloWorld" projects in diffrent languges and build out from there.
<br>I'm mostly self learned in CSS, HTML and Shell Script, as well some basic C# for game dev (in Unity).
<br>
<br>I'm using a early 2015 13" MacBook Pro for the dev work and would love to be able to use the skills from this project to aford a well spec MacBook Pro (or a Framework 16 diy) to have a better workflow.
<br>
<br>At the moment this is just a fun side project to learn diffrent programing languges and show my growing knowlage.
